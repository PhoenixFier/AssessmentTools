# AssessmentTools
This repo will collect various scripts for converting data.

## ConversionTools
	* cracked_accounts.py - This script is meant to take data from password cracking and generate a usable list for frequency analysis. 
	* extract_users.py - This script is meant to take employee names and convert them to the appropriate user name format.
	
## ReconTools
	* whois.sh - This script is meant to take the hosts/targets provided for an assessment, and query WHOIS without hitting client assets. This allows us to proceed without needing approval, or a valid testing window.
